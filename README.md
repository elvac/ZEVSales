### Project Brief
This is a project using open data which was sourced from internet. The project tells a story about Zero Emission Vehicle's development in California in the recent 10 more years and tried to uncover relationship between ZEV sales and other variables. The analysis was mainly used Python to conduct linear regression analysis and used Tableau to visualize the analysis and provide recommendations.

## Data Sets
The project would use open datasets sourced from California Energy Commission (2022), including ZEV sales data, ZEV population data, non-ZEV population data and EV chargers data. Population data by county in California sourced from US Census Bureau would be used as well.  
**Challenges:** Datasets may have missing and inconsistent values.  
**Limitations:** EV chargers dataset is only for 2021 which is a small dataset and not enough to conduct an effective linear regression analysis. Other relevant data which impact on ZEV sales (for example: ZEV action plans and supporting benefits launched from California) is unstructured and hard to be collected from online open data.

## Project Understanding and Analytical Methods
Instead of a project brief, the project can be analyzed any points depending on the analyst's interests. When I collected the open dataset online, the increasing ZEV sales attracted me. It is a definitely new-rising market. I wondered what factors make it developed so fast. According to the collected data, I decided to focus on two variables: fuel prices and the number of EV chargers. I was going to use linear regression analysis to reveal the relationships between ZEV sales and the two variables.


## Outputs
The outputs of the data analysis revealed the relationships between ZEV sales and fuel prices, EV chargers. The final report was delivered by Tableau.
